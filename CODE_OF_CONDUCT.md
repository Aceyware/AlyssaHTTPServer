# Code of Conduct

**TLDR:** KEEP IT PROFESSIONAL! Do not move anything other than software work here. Here is not a theater and there's no place for drama.

I'll keep it simple. Here is a place that people interacts with each other with the aim of doing software. And there should be some rules and guidelines for making sure this purpose is served well.

## That such rules and guidelines:

1. **NO POLITICS:** We are not the people that determines the events or things around the world; nor the ones that going to solve wars etc. We are the ones with no direct affection on anything and we just do software, so don't move any politic thing to here.

2. **Be pure:** Just be a human, and treat others as just humans too. Don't move the ethnicity, sexual orientation or any similar thing to there. Nobody cares about mine, yours or anyone else's ethnicity, sexual orientation or etc.. Neither do any propaganda that's affirming any minority nor do discrimination against anyone. You won't get any semphaty because of such things here.

3. **Behave respectful:** Don't insult others here and give care about everyone's opinions. Just be chill and enjoy the life. It's more meaningful than creating heated arguments.
