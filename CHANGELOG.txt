# Alyssa HTTP Server Changelog
------------------------------

v0.5.1 - 14.09.2022
• HTTP Range Requests is now supported
• Completely rewritten core functions
	• Now files are read as blocks instead of single chars.
	• This hugely improved the file reading and transfer speeds (4MB/s vs. 350MB/s, a.k.a. my I/O limit)
	• CPU usage is much lower despite the much faster speeds (8 simultaneous connections @ 350MB/s uses %8 CPU on my system, a single connection with 4MB/s was using double of that), still needs improvements
• Now Requests with URIs that includes special characters and spaces are supported.
• Fixed the almost fully broken Request Header parser
• Fixed the bug on folder indexes that has files with spaces causes truncated HTML links
• Removed some debugging features
• Now connections are print to console optionally, disabled by default.

v0.5
• Added HTTPS support with TLS 1.2
• Added file and folder count to folder index pages
• Removed port number from folder index pages

v0.4
• First implementation of custom actions. For now it only supports redirections
• HTTP HEAD support
• Non-implemented Requests (HTTP POST,DELETE,etc.) will be responded with 501 Not Implemented, instead of sending nothing and holding connection forever
• Whitelist implementation, when enabled hosts on the list will be dropped just after connection.
• Renewed Request Header parser
• Now hostname always printed to console with IP address instead of hostname.
• Fixed some hardcoded strings
• Some other things that I forgot

v0.3
• Now configuration is actually used.
• Now configuration flies are platform independent (newline terminators were causing problems on ex. when config written on Windows is used on *nix)
• Initial implementation of custom error pages (only 404 is supported for now)
• Folder index pages implemented
	• When enabled, requests to folders will be responded with a page that's index(contents) of folder 
	• Supports icons for folders and files
	• Size of files are shown
	• Folders are listed first, which is a thing Apple couldn't do to their OS since decades
• Now code is C++ 17

v0.2
• Initial code for config implementation
