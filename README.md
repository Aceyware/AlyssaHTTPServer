# Alyssa HTTP Server Project
Alyssa is a lightweight, multiplatform, multiconnection HTTP server. It can just work without hours of configuration. It ~~supports~~ will support custom actions like redirection.
### Incomplete TODO
- [ ] Fixup of bugs and issues
- [ ] Actual keep-alive support
- [ ] SSL support
#### Note for compiling on *nix systems
For now `c++` can compile without a problem. `gcc` gives error on linking, `clang` doesn't even compiles.
