# Alyssa HTTP Server Project
Alyssa is a lightweight, multiplatform HTTP server. It can just work without hours of configuration, on anywhere.
## How to use?
You can use it just out of the box! Just get the latest release, edit ports or other stuff if needed, and run the executable.
## Guides for configuration/compiling/etc.
Detailed guides will be available later. Compilation is only about of giving all .cpp files as input to gcc, setting language standard to C++17 and adding libraries depeding on case. It can work on any platform that has a C++17 compiler.
## Features
- HTTP/2 
- SSL/TLS
- Redirection(soft and hard), authentication
- CGI applications
- IPv6 ready
- Directory index pages.
And more.
