# Configuration
Configuration is done by the Alyssa.cfg file on working directory.

## Configuration file info
- Config file consists of `key value` lines.
- There's no symbols like = or ". You just directly write the key and value. First word till space is key, rest is value.
- Keys are case insensitive.
- If you set a key more than once, first one will be used.
- Lines with # at beginning are comment lines, and will be ignored by server.
- Config is only read at launch of server, you need to restart the server when you do some modification on config.

## List of possible keys and their default values.
### Core
- **htrootpath ./htroot:** Where your htroot is located.
- **respath ./res** Where the resources folder is.
- **Port 80** Ports to listen to. Multiple ports can be listened by doing i.e. `Port 80 800 8000...`
- **htrespath /res** Where the resources located as HTTP relative path. Unrelated to `respath`. 
Changing is not necessary unless your dynamic content stack conflicts with it.

- **RatelimitInterval 0:** Ratelimit interval. If more amount than specified threshold of request will be made, 
ratelimit will be applied for specified milliseconds. Default is 1000 when unspecified.
- **RatelimitThreshold 0:** Threshold that I said above, default is 10 when unspecified.
